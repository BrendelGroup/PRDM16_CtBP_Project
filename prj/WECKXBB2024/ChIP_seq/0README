# In this directory (ChIP_seq), the "0Record" file will execute all the bash scripts that analyze the ChIP-seq data starting from downloading the raw reads up until generating the bigWig files 

#All you have to do to perform the ChIP-seq analysis until the bigWig files generation is to make sure you are inside the "ChIP_seq" directory in the terminal and execute:

bash ./0Record 


# See comments in 0Record for more details on the bash scripts.
