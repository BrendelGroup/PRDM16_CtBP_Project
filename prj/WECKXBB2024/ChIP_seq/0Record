# 1. Acquiring the raw data for the H3K4me3 ChIP-Seq replicates from different developmental stages
bash ./x1_download_raw_reads
#  Derive summary statistics:
cd ./1_Raw_Reads
rws seqkit stats -j 10 *.fastq > summary.stats
rws seqkit stats -j 10 *.fastq -T > summary.tsv
cd ..


# 2. Clean the raw reads and run a quality check on them
bash ./x2_clean_raw_reads


# 3. Align the cleaned raw reads into the the reference genome
bash ./x3_map_reads


# 4. Call the peaks and process them by filtering out blacklist regions and reproducing them + annotating the CTBP2 peaks

# 5. Generate the bigWig files and perform the spike-in normalization for the spiked-in samples
