# To download the genome data for mouse (version mm39), you can simply execute
#  the following command:
#
time bash ./0Record

#real	29m19.926s
#user	68m7.440s
#sys	14m7.783s

# See comments in 0Record for details.

# We also need an mm39 excluderanges, which we obtained from the following link:
#
# https://drive.google.com/file/d/18VWCR7QdpPCpSIwMoTTnMnFK4VuL1Uak/view?usp=drive_link
#  ... provides mm39.excluderanges.bed
#
# Documentation:	https://github.com/dozmorovlab/excluderanges
#
#an exclude ranges file includes coordinates of regions in the genome that attract a lot of noise and artifacts which would negatively affect the ChIP-seq and ATAC-seq analyses. We will filter out anything that maps to the exclude ranges coordinates during our ChIP-seq/ATAC-seq analyses.
