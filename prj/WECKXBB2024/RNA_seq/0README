# In this directory (RNA_seq), each experiment folder (CTBPkdn and PRDM16KO) has a "0Record" that file will execute all the bash scripts that analyses the RNA-seq data starting from downloading the raw reads up until generating the differential gene expression tables and plots 

#All you have to do to perform the RNA-seq analysis is to make sure you are inside an experiment's directory in the terminal and execute:

bash ./0Record 


# See comments in 0Record for more details on the bash scripts.
