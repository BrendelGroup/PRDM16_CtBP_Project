# 1. Acquiring the raw data for the H3K4me3 ChIP-Seq replicates from different developmental stages
bash ./x1_download_raw_reads
#  Derive summary statistics:
cd ./1_Raw_Reads
rws seqkit stats -j 10 *.fastq > summary.stats
rws seqkit stats -j 10 *.fastq -T > summary.tsv
cd ..


# 2. Clean the raw reads and run a quality check on them
bash ./x2_clean_raw_reads


# 3. Align the cleaned raw reads into the the reference genome
bash ./x3_map_reads

# 4. Perform the differential gene expression analysis on the raw counts and get the lists of up and down regulated genes
bash ./x4_DGE_Analysis

# 5. Acquire a concatenated combined list of misregulated genes in the knockout of PRDM16 in both PAX6 and TBR2 positive cells
bash ./x5_combine_PPC_and_TPC_udr_genes
